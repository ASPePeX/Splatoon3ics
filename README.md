This is a quick and dirty parser, that converts the Splatoon 3 schedule from https://splatoon3.ink/ into ical format.

The ics file is updated every 6 hours.

Just import https://aspepex.github.io/Splatoon3ics/salmonrun.ics into your calendar.

For now only Salmon Run, but in time there will be more.
